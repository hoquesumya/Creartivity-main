# Project Description
There are many social media platforms where artists can promote their work, and gaining popularity on these platforms can be an achievement. However, artists often face challenges with these apps, such as determining the best time to share their images or videos, or dealing with their content getting lost among a flood of other posts. Additionally, it can be difficult to get hired for contract jobs or sell art through non-traditional methods like bidding systems.

Creartivity is a web-based, scalable application designed to help artists securely share and sell their artwork, both through regular sales and bidding. The platform enables artists to connect with art buyers and find contract work for various events. By leveraging AI, Creartivity also recommends artworks that are likely to perform well in the market, giving artists insights to help them succeed (Future plan)

# Microservices

We're using microservices because they offer several benefits in terms of scalability, flexibility, and maintainability, even though it might not be strictly necessary for this application. The goal here is to design the architecture with a microservices approach for learning purposes. While the scope of each service will be small to start with, the design allows for later scaling up the scope of individual services or consolidating them into a monolith if needed, depending on how the app's usage evolves and whether it proves useful to users.

This approach gives us the flexibility to experiment with different parts of the system, optimize performance, and adapt the architecture as the needs of the application change.
